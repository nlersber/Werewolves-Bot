Index.js:

Limit coding in index.js to code that needs top-level access. If it can be done with a class, use a class.
Keep regions collapsed unless needed for a cleaner editor.


Commandos: 

Make command names somewhat descriptive.
If checking for conditions, remove messages if needed for clarity and return out of run method. Don't use nested code if it's not necessary.
Keep track of typing in comments if needed.
Work with blocks of related code. Checks, changing data, etc. Use a comment to annotate its use to keep the run method clean and clear.


Classes:

Keep their scope and use limited. Have a single purpose for each one. 
Use them to encapsulate code and make re-use simple (e.g. saving data to JSON).
Try to make simpletons clear. Export an instance if you need a singleton. Export the class if you need to make objects.
Managers are always singletons. 
Register each manager with the CheckManager if it needs some kind of checking. It uses a variation of a Strategy pattern to check.
